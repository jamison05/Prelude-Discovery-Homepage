    <h1>What is the future with technology?</h1>
    <p>Many think of dark uses with machine learning, with robots having world domination,
      humans with no purpose, and a more out of touch society that is more connected virtually
      rather than humanely.  This is true already.  But what if machines and AI can capture more of our humanity,
      but alternativevly allow for humans to work with machines promoting more humanity instead of mechanistic efficiency.
      This is my ultimate goal in this short representative
      of projects.

      <h1>New look into AI teechnology</h1>
      <p>As the internet, social media, and machine learning increases,
      the major question that many have is how can these tools synergize
      and complement human endeavors and tasks.  One use that I could foresee
      is learning in STEM-related subjects.

    <h1>Innovating into Education</h1>
    <p>Education is moving to a more electronic, social, and network-based platform. With these advances,
       music is a strong component in every aspect of society.  However, what if you can use sounds to model
       variables and ideas.  Music and the sounds associated to it is usually abstracted to certain ideas
       based on variety of musical components.  Some of these components could be correlated to variables of
       increasing and decreasing effects.
    </p>

    <p>
        For this project, I wanted to explore if a music synthâ€™s can be
       partially controlled by fuzzy logic values  and whether they indicate what is happening in the graph.
       This is what motivated my creation of Fuzzy Logic Designed Audio Synthesis.  Unfortunately, I did not
       have the time to fully implement it into an engaging Android App at the time of writing this document.
       But I will present the audio as graphical components on this website.  When launched into an
       educational game format,  the game may positively impact user/learner engagement and versatility in the
       presentation of the concept.   What I mean by versatility is that this format could have more complex implementation and modulation compared to a graph.  Also, the sound platform highlights temporal components that may not be recognized as easily with graphs. In addition, a launched worldwide App would give a good indicator of how traction and usage of audio modeling impact users.   Furthermore, I would want to make it organic to further integration with music that has steady beats such a Reggaeton, Soca, Electro, and certain types of Hip-hop.

  <h1>The Fuzzy Truth</h1>
  <p>What are Fuzzy logic structures?  They are a type of modeling for muti-valued conditional structures that are based not on hard booleans values but on graded or (fuzzy) truths.  The subjects that were used in this audio modeling were conditions influencing population genetic drift, health, and faith and hope. These subjects do not have hard output straight-forward output for every instance, but in a wide spectrum of results and responses to input. The audio synthesizer was created with granular type synth that takes bits of small chunks of audio and feeds them back into the audio output giving a granular effect to the audio.
