  <h1>Sound Modeling Fuzzy Ideas</h1>
<article>
  <article class = "subhead1">
    <p>So as the internet, social media, and machine learning increases,
    the major question that many have is how can these tools synergize
    and complement human endeavors and tasks.  One use that I could foresee
     is learning in STEM-related subjects.</p>

     <p>Education is moving to a more electronic, social, and network-based platform. With these advances, music is a strong component in every aspect of society.  However, what if you can use sounds to model variables and ideas.  Music and the sounds associated to it is usually abstracted to certain ideas based on variety of musical components.  Some of these components could be correlated to variables of increasing and decreasing effects.  For this project, I wanted to explore if a music synthâ€™s can be partially controlled by fuzzy logic values  and whether they indicate what is happening in the graph.   This is what motivated my creation of Fuzzy Logic Designed Audio Synthesis.  Unfortunately, I did not have the time to fully implement it into an engaging Android App at the time of writing this document.  But I will present the audio as graphical components on my personal website.  When launched into an educational game format,  the game may positively impact user/learner engagement and versatility in the presentation of the concept.   What I mean by versatility is that this format could have more complex implementation and modulation compared to a graph.  Also, the sound platform highlights temporal components that may not be recognized as easily with graphs. In addition, a launched worldwide App would give a good indicator of how traction and usage of audio modeling impact users.   Furthermore, I would want to make it organic to its further integration with music that has steady beats such a Reggaeton, Soca, Electro, and certain types of Hip-hop.</p>

    <p>What are Fuzzy logic structures?  They are a type of modeling for muti-valued conditional structures that are based not on hard booleans values but graded or (fuzzy) truths.  The subjects that were used in this audio modeling were conditions influencing population genetic drift, factors influencing health, and factors influencing faith and hope. These subjects do not have hard output. More specifically, the audio synthesizer was specific with a granular type synth that takes bits of small chunks of audio and them  back into the audio output.
